# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Open SWE is an open-source coding-agent framework built on **LangGraph** + **Deep Agents** (`deepagents.create_deep_agent`). It runs as a LangGraph app: each thread spawns its own isolated cloud sandbox, and the agent is invoked from Slack, Linear, or GitHub (PR comments, plus auto-review on opened / ready-for-review).

A separate **reviewer** graph runs read-only code reviews on PRs, and a **review-style analyzer** graph learns per-repo review style from historical PRs.

## Commands

Dependencies are managed with **uv**. Tests use pytest (`asyncio_mode = "auto"`). Lint/format is **ruff** (line-length 100, target py311). Type checking is **basedpyright** (`typeCheckingMode = "standard"`). `requires-python = ">=3.11"`; `langgraph.json` pins the runtime to 3.12.

```bash
make install            # uv sync --extra dev (pytest, ruff, …)
make dev                # uv run langgraph dev — serves all three graphs + the FastAPI app from langgraph.json
make run                # uvicorn agent.webapp:app --reload --port 8000 (FastAPI only, no LangGraph runtime)
make test               # uv run pytest -vvv tests/
make test TEST_FILE=tests/github/test_open_pull_request.py    # single test file
uv run pytest -vvv tests/github/test_open_pull_request.py::test_name  # single test
make lint               # ruff check + ruff format --diff
make format             # ruff format + ruff check --fix
make typecheck          # basedpyright agent tests
```

`langgraph.json` declares three graph entrypoints and the FastAPI app, all served together by `langgraph dev`:

| Graph | Entrypoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | `agent.server:traced_agent` (wraps `get_agent`) | Main coding agent (Slack/Linear/GitHub-triggered). |
| `reviewer` | `agent.reviewer:traced_reviewer_agent` (wraps `get_reviewer_agent`) | Read-only PR reviewer. Findings model + `publish_review`. |
| `analyzer` | `agent.analyzer:traced_analyzer` (wraps `get_analyzer`) | Learns per-repo reviewer style from historical PRs and this reviewer's own finding outcomes. |

The FastAPI app is `agent.webapp:app`.

## Architecture

### Entrypoints

- **`agent/server.py` → `get_agent(config)`** — main graph factory. Called per-thread. Resolves the GitHub token, gets-or-creates the sandbox for the thread, resolves the team/profile/per-thread model + effort, then constructs a fresh `create_deep_agent(...)` with the curated tool list and middleware stack. The agent itself is stateless — all per-thread state lives in the sandbox + thread metadata.
- **`agent/reviewer.py` → `get_reviewer_agent(config)`** — reviewer graph factory. Shares `ensure_sandbox_for_thread` with the main agent but wires a reviewer-only toolset (`add_finding`, `update_finding`, `list_findings`, `publish_review`, `web_search`, `fetch_url`, `http_request`) and a different system prompt that pins the single-evolving-findings model and the diff-anchored bar for filing a finding. Read-only: no commit/push/PR-opening tools.
- **`agent/analyzer.py` → `get_analyzer(config)`** — small graph that emits a per-repo style prompt via the `save_review_style_prompt` tool, consumed by the reviewer as a "repository-specific review style" appendix. It runs in one of two modes (`analyzer_mode` in `configurable`): **bootstrap** (cold-start: crawl historical PR reviews) and **continual** (nightly: refine using this reviewer's own finding outcomes via `read_finding_outcomes`). Each mode's procedure lives in a deepagents **skill** (`agent/skills/bootstrap-repo-analysis/`, `agent/skills/continual-learning/`) served as virtual files via a `CompositeBackend` `/skills/` route + `StateBackend` (seeded into the run's `files` channel by the launcher — never written to the sandbox). Launchers and the per-repo nightly cron live in `agent/dashboard/review_style_jobs.py` and `agent/dashboard/analyzer_cron.py`; the cron is registered when bootstrap completes.
- **`agent/webapp.py`** — custom FastAPI routes mounted alongside the LangGraph server. Webhooks land here (GitHub, Linear, Slack). Each webhook resolves a deterministic `thread_id` (so follow-up messages route to the same agent run) and triggers/streams a run via the `langgraph_sdk` client. Also auto-reviews PRs on `opened` / `ready_for_review` events when the repo+author opt in.
- **`agent/dashboard/`** — `router` mounted under the FastAPI app at startup (`app.include_router(dashboard_router)`). Owns GitHub OAuth, per-user profiles, admin endpoints, team defaults, enabled-repo lists, review-style management, and the Agents chat thread API used by the UI in `ui/`.

### Sandbox lifecycle (the tricky part)

`SANDBOX_BACKENDS` (in `agent/utils/sandbox_state.py`) is an in-process dict keyed by `thread_id`. Thread metadata persists `sandbox_id` across processes. `ensure_sandbox_for_thread` handles three cases:

1. Sandbox cached in memory → ping it (`echo ok`), then refresh the GitHub proxy.
2. Metadata has an id but no cache → reconnect, then refresh the GitHub proxy.
3. No sandbox at all → create one and persist the id.

Only case 3 creates. An existing sandbox that can't be reached raises `SandboxUnreachableError` (`agent/utils/sandbox_state.py`) rather than being replaced: a replacement is empty, so swapping one in would destroy uncommitted work while looking like a recovery. The main agent catches that in `PrepareAgentRunMiddleware` and notifies the user via `post_sandbox_unreachable_notification`.

`allow_replacement=True` opts out of that protection and is passed **only** by the reviewer (`agent/reviewer.py:_ensure_reviewer_sandbox_for_thread`), whose sandbox holds nothing but a checkout `prepare_review_repo` re-derives every run. Reviewer threads are one-per-PR and outlive their sandbox, so without this a deleted sandbox bricks reviews on that PR permanently.

For `SANDBOX_TYPE=langsmith` (default), every sandbox creation/refresh also calls `_configure_github_proxy` with a fresh GitHub App installation token (`get_github_app_installation_token`). The proxy injects Basic auth for `github.com` git traffic and Bearer auth for `api.github.com`, so sandbox commands run plain `gh ...` with no real token in the sandbox. Other providers (modal, daytona, runloop, e2b, local) skip the proxy step. Provider is selected via `SANDBOX_TYPE`; factory is `agent/utils/sandbox.py:create_sandbox` (`SANDBOX_FACTORIES` maps each provider name to a creator in `agent/integrations/`).

Every run re-applies `git config --global user.name/email` for the bot identity, because reused/reconnected sandboxes can lose `--global` config and Vercel preview deploys reject commits whose author email doesn't resolve to a GitHub account.

### Middleware stack (order matters)

Configured in `agent/server.py:get_agent`, runs around every model call (in this order):

1. `SanitizeToolInputsMiddleware` — strips/normalizes tool inputs before they reach tools.
2. `ModelCallLimitMiddleware` (from `langchain.agents.middleware`) — caps model calls at `MODEL_CALL_RECURSION_LIMIT` (~half of `DEFAULT_RECURSION_LIMIT`); `exit_behavior="end"`.
3. `ToolErrorMiddleware` — catches tool exceptions and surfaces them as tool messages.
4. `check_message_queue_before_model` — pulls Linear comments / Slack messages that arrived mid-run from the thread queue and injects them as user messages before the next LLM call. This is what makes "message the agent while it's working" work.
5. `notify_step_limit_reached` — after-agent hook that posts a Slack reply when the agent hits the step limit, so the user gets a clear signal instead of silence.
6. `ModelFallbackMiddleware` (optional, last) — added only when `LLM_FALLBACK_MODEL_ID` or the per-model default fallback differs from the primary model.

The system prompt instructs the agent to call a tool every turn; nothing re-injects one, so a model turn with no tool call ends the run.

Other middleware exists in `agent/middleware/` (`ExcludeToolsMiddleware`) but isn't wired into the default agent. The reviewer uses a leaner stack: `SanitizeToolInputsMiddleware`, `ModelCallLimitMiddleware`, `ToolErrorMiddleware`.

### Tools

All tools live in `agent/tools/` and are flat-imported via `agent/tools/__init__.py`. The set is intentionally small and curated — see README "Tools — Curated, Not Accumulated".

Wired into `get_agent`:
`http_request`, `fetch_url`, `web_search`, `linear_comment`, `linear_create_issue`, `linear_delete_issue`, `linear_get_issue`, `linear_get_issue_comments`, `linear_list_teams`, `linear_search_issues`, `linear_update_issue`, `request_pr_review`, `schedule_thread_wakeup`, `slack_add_reaction`, `slack_read_thread_messages`, `slack_thread_reply`.

Reviewer-only tools (in `agent/reviewer.py`): `add_finding`, `update_finding`, `list_findings`, `publish_review`. The review-style analyzer uses `save_review_style` (exported as `save_review_style_prompt`).

Built-in deepagents tools (`read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `delete`, `ls`, `glob`, `grep`, `execute`, `task` for subagent spawning, …) are added by `create_deep_agent` itself; don't duplicate them.

### Models, profiles, and team defaults

Model + reasoning effort are resolved per run in this precedence (highest wins):

1. Per-thread config (`agent_model_id` + `agent_effort` in `configurable`) — set by webhooks/UI.
2. Per-user dashboard profile override (`agent/dashboard/agent_overrides.py:load_profile`), keyed by resolved GitHub login.
3. Team default model (`agent/dashboard/team_settings.py:get_team_default_model("agent")`).

Supported model IDs and per-model effort/reasoning rules live in `agent/dashboard/options.py`. Profile preferences also control draft PRs and CI automation. Model construction goes through `agent/utils/model.py` (`make_model`, `provider_model_kwargs`, `fallback_model_id_for`).

### Auth

- **GitHub**: dual-mode. User OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest in the dashboard OAuth store and cached only in process during a run (`utils/auth.py:resolve_github_token`, `utils/github_token.py`). When no user token is available, falls back to a GitHub App installation token (`utils/github_app.py`). The installation token is also what configures the LangSmith sandbox's GitHub proxy.
- **Webhooks**: GitHub signatures verified in `utils/github_comments.py:verify_github_signature`; Slack/Linear handled in their respective utils.
- **Dashboard / UI**: GitHub OAuth login lives in `agent/dashboard/oauth.py` and `routes.py` (`/auth/login`, `/auth/callback`, `/auth/logout`, `/me`).

### Thread-id derivation

Webhooks compute deterministic thread ids so the same Linear issue / Slack thread / PR routes back to the same running agent. See `utils/github_comments.py:get_thread_id_from_branch` and the equivalents in `utils/linear.py` / `utils/slack.py`. Reviewer threads have their own deterministic ids and are tagged with `REVIEWER_THREAD_KIND` metadata so the FastAPI side can find them.

## Conventions

- Tests are unit-only by default (`tests/`). Integration tests would go under `tests/integration_tests/` (currently empty — `make integration_tests` no-ops if missing).
- New sandbox providers: add a module under `agent/integrations/` and wire it into `SANDBOX_FACTORIES` in `agent/utils/sandbox.py`. See `docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md`.
- New tools: add to `agent/tools/`, export from `agent/tools/__init__.py`, add to the `tools=[...]` list in `server.py:get_agent` (or `reviewer.py` for reviewer-only tools).
- New middleware: add to `agent/middleware/`, export from `agent/middleware/__init__.py`, add to the `middleware=[...]` list in `server.py:get_agent` — order is significant (see the stack above).
- New dashboard endpoints: add to `agent/dashboard/routes.py`. The router is auto-mounted on the FastAPI app.
- New graphs: register the entrypoint in `langgraph.json` under `graphs`.
- Minimal-to-no code comments — only when the *why* isn't obvious from the code.
- Do not add feature documentation to this file. Shipping a feature earns it **no** line here — not a section, not a pointer, not a resolution order or a list of which module wins. Anyone can read that from the code. Feature detail belongs in the code, its docstrings, and the PR description. Only edit this file when asked to, or when something it already claims has become wrong.
