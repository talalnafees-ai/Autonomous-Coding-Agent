"""Shared builders for full-content GitHub diffs.

Fetches the changed files of a pull request — or of an arbitrary
``base...head`` comparison, for a branch that has no pull request — together
with their full original/modified contents, so the UI can render
syntax-highlighted diffs with pierre's ``MultiFileDiff``. Used by the thread
branch diff endpoint (user token) and the review diff endpoint (App
installation token).
