"""Per-PR auto-fix opt-out, stored in the LangGraph Store.

Auto-fix is gated by the per-user ``auto_fix_ci`` profile flag.
On top of that, a single PR can be silenced with ``@open-swe autofix off`` (and
re-enabled with ``@open-swe autofix on``), mirroring Cursor's
``@cursor autofix off`` per-PR control. The toggle lives here rather than on the
agent thread so a disable command is honored even before any fix run exists.
