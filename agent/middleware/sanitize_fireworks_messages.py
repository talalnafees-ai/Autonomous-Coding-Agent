"""Strip legacy ``function_call`` fields before Fireworks provider calls.

The LangSmith LLM Gateway enforces strict request-schema validation and rejects
messages carrying the legacy OpenAI ``function_call`` field
(``Extra inputs are not permitted, field: 'messages[N].function_call'``).
``langchain_fireworks`` forwards ``function_call`` from
``AIMessage.additional_kwargs`` whenever it is present — even when the message
also carries modern ``tool_calls`` — so a message that was originally produced
by (or deserialized from) a provider that populated the legacy field will break
every subsequent Fireworks turn once routed through the gateway.

This middleware drops the redundant legacy field from assistant messages before
they reach the Fireworks serializer, mirroring the thinking-block sanitizer.
