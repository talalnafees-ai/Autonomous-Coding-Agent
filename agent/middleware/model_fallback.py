"""Middleware that retries model calls across a primary and fallback provider.

Wraps the model call. When a model raises a transient provider error (5xx,
429, connection/timeout, or a ``ModelCallTimeoutMiddleware`` deadline), the
request is retried, alternating between the
primary and the configured fallback model with exponential backoff between
attempts. The fallback is bound to tools by the agent factory on each call,
so swapping ``request.model`` is sufficient.

Why alternate with backoff instead of failing over once: both providers can
be routed through the same LLM Gateway, so a gateway outage takes out the
"cross-provider" fallback too. A single immediate failover cannot ride out
even a short shared outage (the gateway's 502 page literally says "try again
in 30 seconds"), and an unprotected fallback call crashes the whole run.
Alternating with a backoff schedule that reaches past 30s lets a long-running
agent run survive multi-minute provider or gateway blips.

Bidirectional: if the primary is Anthropic the fallback is typically OpenAI,
and vice versa. The middleware itself is provider-agnostic — it inspects the
exception type/status code to decide whether an attempt is retryable.

If every attempt fails, the middleware either raises the last error or (by
default) returns a terminal ``AIMessage`` explaining the outage, so the run
ends with a visible message in Slack/GitHub instead of an abrupt crash. The
turn's progress is checkpointed, so the user can retrigger to continue.
