            updates that environment rather than creating a second one. The name
            ``default`` is the environment every run boots from; any other name
            is a draft nobody boots from.
        prompt: The complete instruction text appended to every run's system
            prompt in this environment. This is a full replacement — pass the
            whole text, not a delta. Empty string clears it.
        repos: Optional ``owner/repo`` list this environment covers, for the
            dashboard. Does not clone anything by itself.
        mem_bytes: Optional memory capacity for newly-created sandbox VMs.
        vcpus: Optional virtual CPU count for newly-created sandbox VMs.
        fs_capacity_bytes: Optional filesystem capacity for newly-created sandbox VMs.
            Omitted sizing fields keep provider defaults when creating an environment,
            or preserve the existing values when updating one.
        clear_sizing: Restore provider defaults by clearing all three sizing overrides.
            Cannot be combined with a sizing value.
        create_params: Additional LangSmith sandbox create-body fields, such as
            ``_internal_runtime`` or ``proxy_config``. This object is persisted and
            must never contain secrets or authentication credentials. Omit it when
