    """Update fields on an existing finding.

    Use this on a re-review run to mark an existing finding as resolved or
    dismissed, or to revise its severity/description/suggestion if the new
    commits changed the situation.

    Args:
        finding_id: The id returned by ``add_finding`` (or shown in the
            ``Existing findings`` block of the re-review user message).
        status: New status (``open``, ``resolved``, ``dismissed``).
            Use ``resolved`` when the new commits address the issue. Resolving
            or dismissing requires a ``note`` with the full message to post.
        severity: New severity, if reassessing.
        confidence: New confidence rating (``low``, ``medium``, ``high``), if
            new commits change how sure you are the finding is a real issue.
        title: New concise generated headline, if revising.
        description: New description body, if revising. Do not repeat ``title``
            as the first line.
        suggestion: New replacement text. Pass an empty string to clear it.
            Capped at 4 lines — longer values are dropped (the finding keeps
            its description). Only set this for small, obvious fixes.
        note: Optional free-form note explaining the change. Required when
            resolving or dismissing because it is posted verbatim as the full
            GitHub reply body.

    Returns:
        Dictionary with ``success`` and (on success) the updated ``finding``.
