"""Per-thread snapshot of the profile settings a conversation runs under.

Threads are multi-party and long-lived: anyone can reply, and any participant can
edit their dashboard profile at any time. Thread-level model and repository
settings are therefore resolved once on the first run and stored on the thread.
Sender identity, personal instructions, and PR preferences remain per-message
context.

Later changes reach a thread only when something explicitly rewrites the
snapshot, which today means a per-run model override.
