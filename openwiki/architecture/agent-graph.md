# Agent Graph & get_agent Factory

`get_agent(config)` in `agent/server.py` compiles the main coding-agent graph for each run. It is the composition boundary that resolves thread and sender context, selects the sandbox and models, constructs the filesystem/tool/subagent surface, and supplies the resulting pieces to `create_deep_agent`.

## Entrypoint and execution gate

`langgraph.json` registers `agent.graphs.agent:traced_agent` as the `agent` graph. The module only re-exports the server factory and wrapper. `traced_agent` is `traced_graph_factory(get_agent, AGENT_TRACING_PROJECT)`: it awaits construction and yields the graph inside LangSmith project `open-swe-agent`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Runtime as LangGraph runtime
    participant Entry as traced_agent
    participant Factory as get_agent
    participant Sandbox as Sandbox backend
    participant Deep as create_deep_agent

    Runtime->>Entry: invoke with RunnableConfig
    Entry->>Factory: await factory config
    Factory->>Factory: check thread and execution flag
    alt executable thread run
        Factory->>Sandbox: start cached proxy and reconnect if needed
        Factory->>Factory: resolve settings tools backend and middleware
        Factory->>Deep: assemble graph
    else non-execution load or no thread
        Factory->>Deep: assemble bare graph
    end
    Deep-->>Factory: configured graph
    Factory-->>Entry: graph
    Entry-->>Runtime: yield under tracing context
```
The factory takes a cheap bare-graph path for non-execution loading and a full per-thread assembly path for an executable run.

Before either path, the factory sets `config["recursion_limit"]` to `DEFAULT_RECURSION_LIMIT` (9,999), LangGraph's superstep budget. It only performs full assembly when `configurable.thread_id` exists and `graph_loaded_for_execution` finds a true `__is_for_execution__` flag. Otherwise it returns `create_deep_agent(system_prompt="", tools=[])`, without a sandbox or supplied middleware. This keeps graph discovery and schema-oriented loads from provisioning run resources.

## Resolution and assembly flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Input["RunnableConfig"] --> Gate{"thread id and execution flag"}
    Gate -- no --> Bare["Bare create_deep_agent"]
    Gate -- yes --> Identity["Resolve sender GitHub login"]
    Identity --> Backend["Start cached sandbox proxy"]
    Backend --> Settings["Load thread settings and defaults"]
    Settings --> Models["Resolve and build main subagent and title models"]
    Models --> Surface["Build static tools dynamic groups skill routes and subagents"]
    Surface --> Stack["Order main middleware"]
    Stack --> Full["create_deep_agent with composite backend"]
```
This flow distinguishes stable, persisted thread choices from per-run credentials and execution resources.

### Identity, backend, and settings ownership

`profile_login` is resolved from the GitHub login in `configurable`, or from the triggering email (including a Slack triggering email). It represents the sender of the message that started this run and governs authorization and credentialed integrations. In contrast, the thread carries the frozen model and repository-instruction settings; a later sender does not implicitly replace those choices.

The factory gets a cached `SandboxBackendProxy` keyed by thread and starts it. Its reconnect callback creates a `LocalShellBackend` for desktop runs; other runs call `ensure_sandbox_for_thread` with the selected environment slug. Thus the graph holds a reconnectable thread-bound backend rather than directly owning a sandbox instance.

Model/effort resolution begins with team defaults, applies dashboard profile overrides, then stored thread settings, and finally accepts an explicit `agent_model_id`/`agent_effort` only if it is supported and the effort is valid for that model. That explicit pair is the sole per-run input allowed to move an existing thread from its stored selection. Resolved main and subagent choices (and repository instructions) are persisted on non-desktop runs before the deployment-wide Fable gate is applied, so a current deployment gate is evaluated every run. Main, subagent, and title models are constructed with provider-specific kwargs; `_make_model_or_defer` converts construction failures into a deferred error model so the factory still returns a graph and the failure appears when the model is called.

A fallback middleware is created only when the configured or derived fallback id differs from the primary model. The fallback is deliberately outside the call-timeout middleware, allowing a timed-out primary call to escalate.

## Prompt preparation and run state

The factory passes an empty `system_prompt` to `create_deep_agent`. `PrepareAgentRunMiddleware` instead resolves run-dependent context during its before-agent hook and calls `construct_system_prompt`; that renderer fills `SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` with working directory, source, repository, plan, environment, and feature-gated sections, then appends the static `OPEN_SWE_SHARED_BASE`.

The result is stored as `rendered_system_prompt` in graph state. `BasePrepareRunMiddleware.awrap_model_call` prepends it to any existing system message and applies `wrap_system_prompt` on every model request. Preparation is checkpointed with a fingerprint of middleware, latest message, and configuration: `run_prepared_for` skips repeat setup for a resumed invocation, but preparation must be idempotent because a failure before checkpointing can run it again. A new message or relevant configuration makes the fingerprint change and prepares fresh context.

The prompt instructs the agent to make a tool call every turn. Since no component fabricates a missing call, a model response with no tool call is the normal end of the run.

## Filesystem and skills

The deep agent receives a `CompositeBackend` whose default route is the sandbox. Read-only routes overlay skill locations:

- Bundled skills use a virtual `FilesystemBackend`.
- Hosted organization skills use a namespaced `StoreBackend`; sender-specific user skills use a separately namespaced store route when a login is available.
- Desktop user skills use a read-only `StateBackend` snapshot rather than the hosted store.

The selected routes form an ordered `skill_sources` list supplied to both the parent and general-purpose subagent. On desktop, `/large_tool_results/` and `/conversation_history/` are additionally routed to virtual filesystem directories outside the checked-out project. This prevents Deep Agents' offloaded results and evicted history from becoming repository changes or being captured by `git add -A`. The backend passed to `create_deep_agent` also enables its built-in filesystem result eviction and history summarization/offloading behavior.

## Tool surfaces and plan mode

`static_tools` is an intentionally curated parent surface, not every export in `agent.tools`. It includes web, plan, background, Linear, thread, PR, Slack, and skill-management operations. It is adjusted for trusted Slack source context, admin-thread workspace tools, and sandbox-download capability; desktop reduces it to web request/search tools and stop-summary mode reduces it to the Slack read/reply pair.

Browser tools are loaded only for non-desktop, non-stop-summary runs. `DynamicToolMiddleware` exposes integration *schemas* through `load_integration_tools`, then adds selected tools to subsequent model calls. In this factory, Observability, Currents, and Notion are first loaded while assembling the graph and passed as eager groups; the middleware still requires the model to select their names before exposing them. Corridor is different: its static allowlist creates an `IntegrationGroup` whose loader performs the cached MCP load only after selection. Group loads are serialized per group, failures are logged and become an unavailable-tool response rather than an exception, and `loaded_integration_tools` is reset at each `before_agent` hook. Reserved Deep Agent and static names prevent catalog collisions.

`ExcludeToolsMiddleware` removes permanently unsafe/unwanted names after the dynamic layer: `DEEP_AGENT_EXCLUDED_TOOLS` currently excludes `grep`; stop-summary mode also excludes built-in mutating filesystem/delegation tools (`delete`, `edit_file`, `execute`, `task`, and `write_file`).

`PlanModeMiddleware` is installed for every full graph and is state-aware, not merely a factory-time filter. Its `before_agent` hook resets state to the factory's `configurable.plan_mode is True` value, so a stale state value from a prior run does not leak into a later run. An `enter_plan_mode` tool call can set state during the run; filtering is recomputed on the next model turn. `approve_plan` clears the state after it verifies active plan mode and persists the approved status. In plan mode the factory's exclusion set removes delegation, background execution, PR and sandbox mutation, selected skill/thread/Slack/Linear mutations, environment management, and automation operations: `create_automation`, `update_automation`, `trigger_automation`, and `delete_automation`. Read-only operations, filesystem tools, `save_plan`, and `approve_plan` remain available. `execute` also remains exposed; the prompt, rather than middleware, imposes the no-mutating-command discipline. Excluding `task` is essential because a general-purpose subagent is a separate graph and would otherwise not inherit the parent's plan-mode filter.

## Subagents

The general-purpose subagent is always supplied. `_general_purpose_subagent` retains the Deep Agents general-purpose name and mechanics prompt, prefixes the Open SWE shared base, shares the ordered skills, and removes background execution plus parent-context-sensitive Slack and thread tools. It may receive the same dynamic integration middleware as the parent. A browser subagent is appended only when browser tools were loaded.

Subagents compile as separate graphs, so the parent's model middleware does not wrap their model calls. Each subagent therefore has `SanitizeOpenAIResponsesMiddleware` and `ModelCallTimeoutMiddleware`; the general-purpose spec also has its dynamic and exclusion middleware. This preserves provider-response sanitation and a bounded delegated model call independently of the parent stack.

## Main middleware boundaries

The list passed by the factory is ordered **outermost to innermost**. Its effective boundary order is:

1. `PrepareAgentRunMiddleware`, followed optionally by `DynamicToolMiddleware`.
2. Tool-input sanitization, `ModelCallLimitMiddleware(run_limit=5000, exit_behavior="end")`, tool-error conversion, exclusion, subdirectory-agent reads, and retry of `task` (up to two retries).
3. PR creation guard except on desktop, workflow push guard, GitHub proxy refresh, and message-queue check except for stop summaries.
4. Timeout wrap-up and step-limit notification, then optional model fallback and state-aware plan-mode filtering.
5. Fireworks, OpenAI-response, and thinking-block sanitizers; stable tool-result ordering; finally `ModelCallTimeoutMiddleware`.

The timeout is innermost so it measures the provider call itself and propagates outward to fallback when one is configured. `ModelCallLimitMiddleware` is a separate high ceiling that ends a run at 5,000 calls. Tool exceptions become tool messages, while the explicit `task` retry policy handles retryable delegated-task failures. The factory does not add a custom orphaned-tool-call repairer: `create_deep_agent` supplies its built-in `PatchToolCallsMiddleware`.

## Changing and testing the factory

For an Open SWE fork, change `get_agent` when replacing the sandbox provider, model policy, parent tool surface, subagent definitions, or middleware ordering. Preserve the execution gate and the ordering contracts: moving a guard changes what it wraps, and adding a parent-only guard does not protect compiled subagents.

Focused regression coverage is in:

- `tests/agent/test_agent_assembly_context.py` for backend/skill wiring, parent-only tools, and middleware presence.
- `tests/agent/test_factory_tool_loading.py` for concurrent hosted integration loading.
- `tests/agent/test_plan_mode.py` for plan-mode prompt, state transition, and exclusions.
- `tests/middleware/test_prepare_run_middleware.py` for preparation fingerprints and wrapped prompt injection.
- `tests/models/test_agent_subagent_models.py` for distinct main/subagent profile resolution and Fable gating.
