# Installation Guide

This guide walks you through setting up Open SWE end-to-end: local development, GitHub App creation, LangSmith configuration, webhooks, the web dashboard, and production deployment.

Open SWE has two runnable pieces:

- **The backend** — a LangGraph app (three graphs: `agent`, `reviewer`, `analyzer`) plus a FastAPI app (`agent.webapp:app`) that owns the webhooks and the dashboard API. Both are served together by `langgraph dev`.
- **The dashboard** — a TanStack Start + Vite web app in `ui/` (package name `open-swe-dashboard`). It's a thin client over the FastAPI dashboard API (`/dashboard/api/*`): GitHub-login, per-user model/profile settings, team defaults, enabled-repo and review-style management, user mappings, and the Agents chat UI. It's optional for pure webhook-driven use, but recommended.

> **The steps are ordered to avoid forward references.** Each step only depends on things you've already completed.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11 – 3.13** (3.14 is not yet supported due to dependency constraints)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- [LangGraph CLI](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/cli)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (for local development — exposes webhook endpoints to the internet)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (only if you want to run the dashboard UI locally — see step 8). Node 20+ also works, but `ui/pnpm-lock.yaml` is the canonical lockfile.

## 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/open-swe.git
cd open-swe
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync --all-extras
```

## 2. Start ngrok

You'll need the ngrok URL in subsequent steps when configuring webhooks, so start it first.

```bash
ngrok http 2024 --url https://some-url-you-configure.ngrok.dev
```

You don't need to pass the `--url` flag, however doing so will use the same subdomain each time you startup the server. Without this, you'll need to update the webhook URL in GitHub, Slack and Linear every time you restart your server for local development.

Copy the HTTPS URL you set, or if you didn't pass `--url`, the one ngrok gives you. You'll paste this into the webhook settings in steps 3 and 5.

> Keep this terminal open — ngrok needs to stay running during local development. Use a second terminal for the rest of the steps.

## 3. Create a GitHub App

Open SWE authenticates as a [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps) to clone repos, push branches, and open PRs.

### 3a. Choose your OAuth provider ID

Before creating the app you need to decide on an **OAuth provider ID** — this is a short string you'll use in both GitHub and LangSmith to link the two. Pick something memorable, for example:

```
your-org-github-oauth
```

Write this down. You'll use it in the callback URL below and again in step 4 when configuring LangSmith.

### 3b. Create the app

1. Go to **GitHub Settings → Developer settings → [GitHub Apps](https://github.com/settings/apps) → [New GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/apps/new)**
2. Fill in:
   - **App name**: `Open SWE` (or your preferred name)
   - **Homepage URL**: This can be any valid URL — it's only shown on the GitHub Marketplace page (which you won't be using). Use something like `https://github.com/langchain-ai/open-swe`
   - **Callback URL**: GitHub Apps allow multiple callback URLs (one per line). Add **both**:
     1. `https://smith.langchain.com/host-oauth-callback/<your-provider-id>` — replace `<your-provider-id>` with the ID you chose in step 3a (e.g. `https://smith.langchain.com/host-oauth-callback/your-org-github-oauth`). This is the **agent-runtime** OAuth callback, brokered by LangSmith (step 4b).
     2. `http://localhost:2024/dashboard/api/auth/callback` — the **dashboard-login** OAuth callback (step 8). For production, also add `https://<your-dashboard-api-url>/dashboard/api/auth/callback`. If you distribute the desktop app, add `https://<your-backend-url>/dashboard/api/auth/callback` as well. This is a separate, direct GitHub OAuth flow (not via LangSmith), so it needs its own callback URL.
   - **Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation**: ✅ Enable this
   - **Webhook URL**: `https://<your-ngrok-url>/webhooks/github` — use the ngrok URL from step 2
   - **Webhook secret**: generate one and save it — you'll need it later as `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`:
     ```bash
     openssl rand -hex 32
     ```
3. Set permissions:
   - **Repository permissions**:
     - Contents: Read & write
     - Pull requests: Read & write
     - Issues: Read & write
     - Checks: Read & write — reports an "Open SWE Review" check run on PRs while an auto-review runs and lets `/baby-sit` read third-party CI conclusions. Without it, check-run creation fails (logged, best-effort), reviews still work, and `/baby-sit` fails closed when it cannot read the complete check set.
     - Commit statuses: Read-only — required for `/baby-sit` to evaluate the complete PR status set, including integrations that report via legacy commit statuses instead of check runs.
     - Actions: Read-only — optional for CI diagnostics and log access. Grant **Read & write** only to enable `/baby-sit` to rerun evidence-backed flaky GitHub Actions jobs. Existing installations must approve this permission elevation. Actions write also permits rerunning, canceling, and deleting workflow runs at the token level; `/baby-sit` is instructed to use only failed-job reruns.
     - Workflows: Read & write — required to let Open SWE directly push branches containing explicitly requested GitHub Actions workflow changes.
     - Metadata: Read-only
   - **Organization permissions** (required only if you plan to set `ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS` — see step 5 / Security):
     - Members: Read-only — used to verify org membership for dashboard login and LangSmith trace-tool access via `GET /orgs/{org}/memberships/{username}`. Without this permission that call returns 403 and the check fails closed.
4. Under **Subscribe to events**, enable:
   - `Issue comment`
   - `Pull request review`
   - `Pull request review comment`
   - `Check run` — required for immediate `/baby-sit` failure detection
   - `Check suite` — required for immediate `/baby-sit` failure detection
   - `Workflow run` — required for immediate `/baby-sit` failure detection
   - `Status` — optional; covers integrations that report via the legacy commit-status API
5. Click **Create GitHub App**

### 3c. Collect credentials

After creating the app:

1. **App ID** — shown at the top of the app's settings page. Save this as `GITHUB_APP_ID`.
2. **Private key** — scroll down to **Private keys** → click **Generate a private key**. A `.pem` file will download. Save its contents as `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.
3. **Client ID** — shown near the top of the app's settings page (starts with `Iv...`). Save this as `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID`.
4. **Client secret** — under **Client secrets** → **Generate a new client secret**. Save it as `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`.

> `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` power the **dashboard login** flow (the direct GitHub OAuth in 3b's second callback URL). They are independent of the LangSmith OAuth provider in step 4b — the dashboard talks to GitHub directly, while the agent runtime resolves per-user tokens through LangSmith.

### 3d. Install the app on your repositories

1. From your app's settings page, click **Install App** in the sidebar
2. Select your org or personal account
3. Choose which repositories Open SWE should have access to
4. Click **Install**
5. After installation, look at the URL in your browser — it will look like:
   ```
   https://github.com/settings/installations/12345678
   ```
   or for an org:
   ```
   https://github.com/organizations/YOUR-ORG/settings/installations/12345678
   ```
   The number at the end (`12345678`) is your **Installation ID**. Save this as `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID`.

> **Note**: The installation page may prompt you to authenticate with LangSmith. If you haven't set up LangSmith yet (step 4), that's fine — you can still grab the Installation ID from the URL and complete the OAuth setup later.

## 4. Set up LangSmith

Open SWE uses [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) for:
- **Tracing**: all agent runs are logged for debugging and observability
- **Sandboxes**: each task runs in an isolated LangSmith cloud sandbox

### 4a. Get your API key, project and tenant IDs

1. Create a [LangSmith account](https://smith.langchain.com/) if you don't have one
2. Go to **Settings → API Keys → Create API Key**
3. Save it as `LANGSMITH_API_KEY_PROD`
4. Get your **Tenant ID**: Visit LangSmith, login, then copy the UUID in the URL. Example: if your URL is `https://smith.langchain.com/o/72184268-01ea-4d29-98cc-6cfcf0f2abb0/agents/chat` -> the tenant ID would be `72184268-01ea-4d29-98cc-6cfcf0f2abb0`. Save it as `LANGSMITH_TENANT_ID_PROD`.
5. Get your **Project ID**: open your tracing project in LangSmith, then click on the **ID** button in the top left, directly next to the project name. Save it as `LANGSMITH_TRACING_PROJECT_ID_PROD`

> **Note on per-graph tracing projects.** The graphs trace into separate projects by name — `open-swe-agent` (main agent) and `open-swe-review` (reviewer/analyzer). "View trace" links resolve the correct project ID from these names automatically (via the `LANGSMITH_API_KEY_PROD` client), so make sure projects with these names exist in your tenant. If a name can't be resolved, links fall back to `LANGSMITH_TRACING_PROJECT_ID_PROD`, so set it to whichever project you want links to point at by default.

### 4b. Configure GitHub OAuth (optional but recommended)

This is the **agent-runtime** OAuth provider: it lets each agent run authenticate with the triggering user's own GitHub account, brokered by LangSmith. (It is separate from the dashboard-login OAuth, which uses `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID`/`GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` directly — see step 3c.) Without it, all agent operations use the GitHub App's installation token (a shared bot identity).

**What this affects:**
- **With per-user OAuth**: PRs and commits show the triggering user's identity; each user's GitHub permissions are respected
- **Without it (bot-token-only mode)**: all PRs and commits appear as the GitHub App bot; the app's installation-level permissions are used for everything

To set up per-user OAuth:

1. In LangSmith, go to **Settings → OAuth Providers → Add Provider**
2. Set the **Provider ID** to the same string you chose in step 3a (e.g. `your-org-github-oauth`)
3. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your GitHub App (found on the GitHub App settings page under **OAuth credentials**)
4. Enter the **Authorization URL** as `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize` and the **Token URL** as `https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token`.
5. Leave "Enable PKCE" unchecked.
6. Save. You'll reference this Provider ID as `GITHUB_OAUTH_PROVIDER_ID` in your environment variables.

### 4c. Sandbox snapshots

LangSmith sandboxes provide the isolated execution environment for each agent run. Open SWE boots each sandbox from a pre-built **snapshot** — you build the snapshot once (from a Docker image) and then reference it by UUID.

The image must carry the toolchain agent runs expect — `git`, `gh`, `sfw`, the Docker CLI, and the language runtimes — and must be in a registry LangSmith can pull from. Run `sfw --version` while building the image to populate its binary cache, and set `SFW_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK=1` at runtime so the sandbox proxy does not block its update request.

Build a snapshot in the LangSmith UI (Sandboxes → Snapshots → New), or via the SDK:

```python
from langsmith.sandbox import SandboxClient

client = SandboxClient(api_key="<your key>")
snapshot = client.create_snapshot(
    name="open-swe",
    docker_image="johanneslangchain/open-swe-sandbox:gh-cli-amd64",
    fs_capacity_bytes=128 * 1024**3,
)
print(snapshot.id)
```

You can also use the helper script:

```bash
uv run python scripts/create_sandbox_snapshot.py \
  --name open-swe-gh-cli-amd64 \
  --image johanneslangchain/open-swe-sandbox:gh-cli-amd64
```

Then set the resulting UUID in your environment:

```bash
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT_ID="<snapshot-uuid>"
# Optional; overrides the snapshot's root FS size at sandbox boot. Default is 128 GiB.
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT_FS_CAPACITY_BYTES="137438953472"
# Optional; number of vCPUs per sandbox. Default is 4.
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_VCPUS="4"
# Optional; memory in bytes per sandbox. Default is 16 GiB.
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_MEM_BYTES="17179869184"
# Optional; auto-stop a sandbox after this many seconds of inactivity. Default is 7200 (2 hours). 0 disables.
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_IDLE_TTL_SECONDS="7200"
# Optional; delete a stopped sandbox after this many seconds. Default is 2592000 (30 days). 0 disables.
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_DELETE_AFTER_STOP_SECONDS="2592000"
```

A base snapshot is required when `SANDBOX_TYPE=langsmith` — either `DEFAULT_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT_ID` or the runtime setting described below. The server logs a warning at startup when neither the env var nor a stored setting is present, and sandbox creation fails until one is. The snapshot must include the GitHub CLI; Open SWE authenticates `git` and `gh` through the LangSmith sandbox proxy using runtime-minted GitHub App installation tokens, not deployment-stored GitHub access tokens.

### Environments

An **environment** pairs a prompt with a snapshot every run boots from, and can span several repos. Admins build one from an **admin thread** (the **Admin** toggle in the composer, available when their login or email is in `CONFIGURED_ADMINS`): the agent provisions its own sandbox — cloning repos, installing toolchains, warming caches — and then captures it. The environment named `default` is the one runs use; any other name is a draft. Records are managed on the admin **Environments** page.

With more than one environment configured, a picker appears in the dashboard composer (any signed-in user, names only), and a Slack thread can pick one with an `env:<name>` tag on the message that opens it — `@Open SWE env:staging fix the flaky test`. Only the opening message can: the sandbox is created once, so a later tag would change the prompt but not the image. A run with no selection uses `default`.

Captures are named `openswe-environment-<name>` (the platform appends its own `:latest` tag, and rejects a name that carries one); set `ENVIRONMENT_SNAPSHOT_PREFIX` to replace the `openswe` prefix when several deployments share one LangSmith workspace. Snapshot resolution for a new sandbox is: the run's environment, then the base snapshot below.

### Changing the base snapshot without a redeploy

Admins can override `DEFAULT_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT_ID` at runtime from the **Sandbox** page (**Base snapshot** field). The stored value wins; clearing it falls back to the env var. An environment with a ready snapshot still takes precedence.

The same setting is available over the API, which is how the repo that builds your sandbox image can roll a new snapshot out on its own:

```bash
curl -X PUT "$OPEN_SWE_BASE_URL/dashboard/api/sandbox-settings" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"base_snapshot_id": "<snapshot-uuid>"}'
```

Admin-gated sandbox-settings requests accept two CI credentials in place of the browser session cookie, both as `Authorization: Bearer`:

**GitHub Actions OIDC (preferred — no stored secret).** A workflow with `permissions: id-token: write` mints a short-lived token that GitHub signs and scopes to the repo, ref, and audience it requested. Allowlist it on the deployment:

```bash
ADMIN_OIDC_SUBJECTS="acme/sandbox-images"                       # any workflow/ref in this repo
# or pin the ref with a full subject:
# ADMIN_OIDC_SUBJECTS="repo:acme/sandbox-images:ref:refs/heads/main"
ADMIN_OIDC_AUDIENCE="open-swe"                                  # optional; this is the default
```

`ADMIN_OIDC_SUBJECTS` is the on/off switch — while it is empty, OIDC auth is unavailable. Entries containing `:` are matched against the token's `sub` claim, and `owner/repo` entries against its `repository` claim. The audience is verified either way, defaulting to `open-swe`; override it only if you set the workflow's requested audience to match. Anyone who can run a workflow on an allowlisted repo/ref gets admin on these endpoints, so keep the list to internal repos.

**Admin personal access token.** The token only needs to identify its owner (`GET /user`), and that login (or email) must appear in `CONFIGURED_ADMINS`. Matching by login needs no token permissions; matching by email needs a token that can read email addresses (classic `user:email`, or the fine-grained "Email addresses" read permission) when the account's email isn't public. Prefer a machine user over a human's token.

`secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` works for neither: installation tokens have no user identity, and they are not OIDC tokens. `examples/github-actions/set-base-snapshot.yml` is a copy-ready workflow using the OIDC path.

## 5. Set up triggers

Open SWE can be triggered from GitHub, Linear, and/or Slack. **Configure whichever surfaces your team uses — you don't need all of them.**

### GitHub

GitHub triggering works automatically once your GitHub App is set up (step 3). Users can:
- Tag `@openswe` in issue titles or bodies to start a task
- Tag `@openswe` in issue comments for follow-up instructions
- Tag `@openswe` in PR review comments to have it address review feedback

The handles this deployment answers to default to `@openswe,@open-swe,@openswe-dev` and are configurable — set `OPEN_SWE_MENTION_TAGS` to a comma-separated list. Handles are matched on a word boundary, so `@openswe` does not fire on `@openswe-staging`. Give each deployment a distinct handle when more than one shares a GitHub org, Slack workspace, or Linear workspace.

Which GitHub users can trigger the agent is controlled by the **user mapping** (GitHub login ⇄ work email ⇄ optional Slack ID), stored in the LangGraph Store rather than in code. Manage it in the dashboard under **Admin → User mappings**:

- **Add / update** a single mapping (GitHub login + work email, plus an optional Slack user ID). The list is paged (20 per page).
- Users can also **self-onboard**: when an unmapped person tags Open SWE in Slack, the agent runs with limited (GitHub App installation) permissions and posts a "link your GitHub account" prompt. Completing the org-gated GitHub OAuth login records a `self` mapping (carrying the originating Slack ID and work email). Self-signup is therefore bounded by the same `ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS` gate as dashboard login.

You should also configure which GitHub organizations and/or repositories the agent is allowed to operate on. You can specify allowed orgs, specific `owner/repo` pairs, or both:

```bash
# Allow all repos in these orgs
ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS="langchain-ai,anthropics"

# Allow specific repos (owner/repo format)
ALLOWED_GITHUB_REPOS="some-user/their-repo,another-org/specific-repo"
```

A GitHub or Linear webhook is accepted if the resolved repo's org is in `ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS` **or** the `owner/repo` is in `ALLOWED_GITHUB_REPOS`. If both are empty, all repos are allowed.

For Slack and dashboard requests, `ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS` also adds a prompt-level edit guard. To modify a repository outside those organizations, the user must explicitly request that exact repository with its full `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>` URL. Repository hints, defaults, shorthand, and contextual links do not qualify. This does not bypass the server-side GitHub/Linear webhook filter above or GitHub credential and App installation permissions.

`ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS` also gates **dashboard login**: when set, only GitHub accounts that are active members of one of the listed organizations can complete the OAuth login and receive a session. Membership is verified server-side with the GitHub App installation token (so private memberships are visible and no extra OAuth scope is required), and the check fails closed on any API error. When `ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS` is empty, dashboard login is open to any GitHub account (the prior behavior).

> **Observability access**: when team LangSmith credentials are connected, every active member of an organization in `ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS` can use the read-only LangSmith trace tools. Only list organizations whose full active membership may access team-level trace data. This does not grant Datadog access.

> **Required GitHub App installation and permission**: install the App in every organization listed in `ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS` and grant **Organization → Members: Read-only** (see step 3b). Membership checks resolve each organization's installation and call `GET /orgs/{org}/memberships/{username}`. Missing installations, unapproved permissions, and API errors fail closed. `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID` remains the default installation for ordinary GitHub operations.

### Linear (optional)

Open SWE listens for Linear comments that mention `@openswe`.

**Create a webhook:**

1. In Linear, go to **Settings → API → Webhooks → New webhook**
2. Fill in:
   - **Label**: `Open SWE`
   - **URL**: `https://<your-ngrok-url>/webhooks/linear` — use the ngrok URL from step 2
   - **Secret**: generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` — save this as `LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
3. Under **Data change events**, enable **Comments → Create** only
4. Click **Create webhook**

**Get your API key:**

1. Go to **Settings → API → Personal API keys → New API key**
2. Name it `Open SWE`, select **All access**, and copy the key
3. Save it as `LINEAR_API_KEY`

**Configure team-to-repo mapping:**

Open SWE routes Linear issues to GitHub repos based on the Linear team and project. Edit the mapping in `agent/utils/linear_team_repo_map.py`:

```python
LINEAR_TEAM_TO_REPO = {
    "My Team": {"owner": "my-org", "name": "my-repo"},
    "Engineering": {
        "projects": {
            "backend": {"owner": "my-org", "name": "backend"},
            "frontend": {"owner": "my-org", "name": "frontend"},
        },
        "default": {"owner": "my-org", "name": "monorepo"},
    },
}
```

Users can also override the team/project mapping per-comment by including `repo:owner/name` (or a GitHub URL) in their `@openswe` comment. The mapping is used as a fallback when no repo is specified in the comment text.

### Slack (optional)

**Create a Slack App:**

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) → **Create New App** → **From a manifest**
2. Copy the manifest below, replacing the two placeholder URLs:
   - Replace `<your-provider-id>` with the OAuth provider ID from step 3a
   - Replace `<your-ngrok-url>` with the backend URL from step 2 (or your deployed LangGraph/FastAPI URL in production)

    }
}
```

</details>

3. Install the app to your workspace and copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-...`). Existing installations must reinstall or re-authorize the app after adding `files:write`.

**Slack URL checklist:**

Both Slack URLs must point at the Open SWE backend that serves `agent.webapp:app` (locally, your ngrok URL forwarding to `langgraph dev`; in production, your LangGraph/FastAPI deployment URL), not the dashboard frontend URL.

- **Event Subscriptions → Request URL:** `https://<your-backend-url>/webhooks/slack`
- **Interactivity & Shortcuts → Interactivity Request URL:** `https://<your-backend-url>/webhooks/slack/interactivity`

Slack Block Kit option buttons only work when Interactivity is enabled and pointed at `/webhooks/slack/interactivity`.

**Code channels (early access):**

The default manifest above uses the legacy Slack integration. To enable Slack [code channels](https://api.slack.com/partners/code-channels), open **Admin → Slack integration**, turn on **Slack Code Channels**, copy the generated manifest, update the existing Slack app, and reinstall or re-authorize it. The admin selection is browser-local and only controls which manifest is copied.

In a code channel the whole channel is one Open SWE session, so Open SWE answers messages without requiring an `@`-mention, replies at the channel level by default (or in a thread the user started), reports its session status, and keeps the context bar current. The `manage_code_channel` tool covers channel creation and archival, status and title, context actions and external resources, runtime slash commands, HTML/diff/Block Kit/canvas views, view reconciliation, and canvas content/comments.

This requires the `code_channels:manage` bot scope, the `agent_session_stopped` and `code_channel_action` bot events, and `features.code_channels.enabled`. The feature's `slash_command_url` delivers runtime-registered commands to the signed Open SWE endpoint above, while Block Kit view actions use the normal interactivity endpoint. Code channel messages arrive over the `message.channels` / `message.groups` subscriptions an app already uses; `message.session` is an alternative for apps that want *only* session messages, and subscribing to both does not duplicate deliveries. Code channels are in early access: if your workspace is not enrolled, leave the Admin toggle off — everything else keeps working unchanged.

**Credentials you'll need:**

- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: the Bot User OAuth Token (`xoxb-...`)
- `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`: found under **Basic Information → App Credentials**
- `SLACK_BOT_USER_ID`: the bot's user ID (find it in Slack by clicking the bot's profile)
- `SLACK_BOT_USERNAME`: the bot's display name (e.g. `open-swe`)

**Default repo:**

Slack messages are routed to the Slack default repo (`SLACK_REPO_OWNER`/`SLACK_REPO_NAME`, falling back to `DEFAULT_REPO_OWNER`/`DEFAULT_REPO_NAME` — see step 6) unless the user specifies one with `repo:owner/name` in their message.

Open SWE refuses Slack Connect channels when `conversations.info` reports `is_ext_shared`, before starting an agent run. If Slack cannot verify a channel, it fails closed and does not operate there.

**"Sign in with Slack" account linking (optional):**

The dashboard can let a user link their Slack identity to their GitHub login via Slack OIDC ("Sign in with Slack"). This is what lets a Slack-triggered run resolve to the right GitHub user. To enable it:

1. The manifest above already registers the OIDC redirect (`.../dashboard/api/slack/callback`). Under **OpenID Connect** (or **Sign in with Slack**) make sure the `openid`, `email`, and `profile` user scopes are available.
2. From **Basic Information → App Credentials**, save the app's **Client ID** as `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` and **Client Secret** as `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET`.
3. (Optional) Set `SLACK_TEAM_ID` (your workspace ID, `T...`) to restrict linking to a single workspace.

If `SLACK_CLIENT_ID`/`SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` are unset, the "Sign in with Slack" link is simply disabled; the rest of Slack triggering still works.

```

### Rotating TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY

`TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` accepts either a single Fernet key or a comma- or
newline-separated **ordered list of keys, most-recent-first**. New writes always
encrypt under the first key; reads try every key in order. To rotate without
invalidating already-stored GitHub tokens:

1. Generate a new key: `openssl rand -base64 32`.
2. Prepend it to `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, keeping the old key second:
   ```
   TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY="<new_key>,<old_key>"
   ```
   Restart the server. New encryptions use `<new_key>`; existing ciphertexts
   still decrypt against `<old_key>`.
3. Let active threads cycle (each fresh OAuth flow re-encrypts under the new
   key). After every active thread has re-authed, drop the old key:
   ```
   TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY="<new_key>"
   ```
   Any thread still holding ciphertext under `<old_key>` will fail to decrypt
   and the user will be re-prompted to authenticate — same UX as if the thread
   had never authed.

## 7. Start the backend

Make sure ngrok is still running from step 2, then start the backend in a second terminal:

```bash
make dev          # uv run langgraph dev --no-browser --port 2024
```

`langgraph dev` serves **all three graphs** (`agent`, `reviewer`, `analyzer`) *and* the FastAPI app (`agent.webapp:app`) together on `http://localhost:2024`. The FastAPI app owns both the webhooks and the dashboard API:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /webhooks/github` | GitHub issue/PR/comment webhooks |
| `POST /webhooks/linear` | Linear comment webhooks |
| `GET /webhooks/linear` | Linear webhook verification |
| `POST /webhooks/slack` | Slack event webhooks |
| `POST /webhooks/slack/interactivity` | Slack Block Kit button interactions |
| `GET /webhooks/slack` | Slack webhook verification |
| `GET /dashboard/api/auth/login` | Dashboard GitHub OAuth login |
| `GET /dashboard/api/auth/callback` | Dashboard GitHub OAuth callback (registered on the App in step 3b) |
| `GET /dashboard/api/*` | Dashboard API (profiles, team settings, repos, review styles, threads, …) |
| `GET /health` | Health check |

> `make run` (`uvicorn agent.webapp:app --port 8000`) serves the FastAPI app **without** the LangGraph runtime, on port 8000. The dashboard's Agents chat features call LangGraph, so for full local dev use `make dev` on `:2024`, not `make run`.

## 8. Run the dashboard (optional)

The dashboard is the web app in `ui/`. It's a server-rendered TanStack Start app that calls the FastAPI dashboard API from step 7. Run it in a third terminal:

```bash
pnpm install          # from the repo root: ui/ and desktop/ are one pnpm workspace
make web             # pnpm run dev -> Vite on http://localhost:3000
```

No `ui/.env` is needed: the dev server proxies `/dashboard/api/*` to `DASHBOARD_API_URL`, which defaults to `http://localhost:2024`. Point it elsewhere by exporting that variable before `make web` or `pnpm run dev`. It is read at request time, so the same build can front any backend.

To enable Datadog browser RUM, set `VITE_DATADOG_APPLICATION_ID` and `VITE_DATADOG_CLIENT_TOKEN` when building the dashboard. Optional build-time settings are `VITE_DATADOG_SITE` (default `datadoghq.com`), `VITE_DATADOG_SERVICE` (default `open-swe-dashboard`), `VITE_DATADOG_ENV`, `VITE_DATADOG_VERSION`, `VITE_DATADOG_SESSION_SAMPLE_RATE` (default `100`), and `VITE_DATADOG_SESSION_REPLAY_SAMPLE_RATE` (default `100`). Session Replay is enabled by default for sampled RUM sessions with all content masked; telemetry also strips URL query strings and fragments. Values prefixed with `VITE_` are public in the browser bundle; use a Datadog client token, never an API or application key.

Because the browser only ever talks to `http://localhost:3000`, no **CORS** preflight is involved. `DASHBOARD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000"` is still required, though: the same allowlist is the backend's CSRF gate for every non-GET request, and it compares the browser's `Origin` — the dashboard's — against the origins it knows. Without it, the dashboard reads fine and every save returns `403 CSRF check failed`.

The `osw_session` cookie has to be set on the dashboard origin too: set `DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"` and register `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/api/auth/callback` as a GitHub App callback URL. Keep it on an `http://` URL locally so the cookie uses `SameSite=Lax` rather than `Secure`.

For the dashboard login to succeed, you need (from steps 3c / 6): `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`, `DASHBOARD_JWT_SECRET`, `DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL`, `DASHBOARD_BASE_URL`, and `DASHBOARD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. To reach the admin pages (user mappings, etc.), add your GitHub login or email to `CONFIGURED_ADMINS`.

`pnpm run build`, `pnpm run typecheck` and `pnpm run test` run the same task across the workspace through Turborepo; scope one to a package with `pnpm --filter open-swe-dashboard run <script>`. `pnpm run lint` (oxlint) and `pnpm run format` / `pnpm run format:check` (oxfmt) are not Turborepo tasks — they run once from the root over every JS and TS file in the repo, `ui/`, `desktop/` and `tests/e2e/` alike, so there is no per-package variant to scope to.

### Run the desktop app (optional)

> **Experimental:** The desktop wrapper is an early-access convenience surface. The web UI is
> the recommended way to use Open SWE.

The Electron app in `desktop/` includes the compiled dashboard UI. Run it alongside the Open SWE
backend (and, optionally, the web UI) in separate terminals:

```bash
pnpm install                  # from the repo root
make dev                      # terminal 1
pnpm run dev:desktop          # terminal 2
make web                      # terminal 3, optional web UI
```

Development connects to `http://localhost:2024`. To use a hosted backend instead, run
`pnpm --dir desktop run start -- --backend-url=https://your-backend.example.com` or set
`OPEN_SWE_BACKEND_URL`. Create an unpacked application with `pnpm --dir desktop run pack`, or an
installer with `pnpm --dir desktop run dist`. Packaged builds ask for the organization's backend
URL on first launch and store it locally; they never default to the maintainers' deployment. The
GitHub App must allow `<backend-url>/dashboard/api/auth/callback` for desktop login.

## 9. Verify it works

### GitHub

1. Go to any issue in a repository where the app is installed
2. Create or comment on an issue with: `@openswe what files are in this repo?`
3. You should see:
   - A 👀 reaction on your comment within a few seconds
   - A new run in your LangSmith project
   - The agent replies with a comment on the issue

### Linear

1. Go to any Linear issue in a team you configured in `LINEAR_TEAM_TO_REPO`
2. Add a comment: `@openswe what files are in this repo?`
3. You should see:
   - A 👀 reaction on your comment within a few seconds
   - A new run in your LangSmith project
   - The agent replies with a comment on the issue

### Slack

1. In any channel where the bot is invited, start a thread
2. Mention the bot: `@open-swe what's in the repo?`
3. You should see a reply in the thread with the agent's response.

### Dashboard

1. With the backend (step 7) and UI (step 8) both running, open `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click **Sign in with GitHub** — you'll be sent through the GitHub OAuth flow and back to the dashboard
3. You should land logged-in and be able to see your profile/settings. If your GitHub login or email is in `CONFIGURED_ADMINS`, the **Admin** pages (e.g. User mappings) are available.

## 10. Production deployment

Production runs the backend and dashboard separately.

**Backend — standalone Docker:** the root `Dockerfile` builds a production LangGraph API server image for Open SWE. It is not the sandbox image.

```bash
docker build -t open-swe .

docker run \
  --env-file .env \
  -p 8123:8000 \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -e DATABASE_URI="postgres://postgres:postgres@host.docker.internal:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable" \
  -e REDIS_URI="redis://host.docker.internal:6379" \
  -e LANGGRAPH_AUTH_TYPE="noop" \
  -e LANGGRAPH_URL="https://<your-backend-url>" \
  -e DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL="https://<your-dashboard-or-backend-url>" \
  open-swe
```

The example above assumes Postgres and Redis run on the Docker host. `host.docker.internal` only resolves automatically on Docker Desktop, so `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` is what makes it work on a plain Linux Docker Engine. If Postgres and Redis run as their own containers, drop the flag and point `DATABASE_URI` / `REDIS_URI` at their service names on a shared Docker network instead.

Set all environment variables from step 6, plus the standalone Agent Server requirements: `DATABASE_URI`, `REDIS_URI`, `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` (unless tracing is disabled for your deployment), and `LANGGRAPH_CLOUD_LICENSE_KEY` for the production LangGraph server. Expose the container's port `8000` through your ingress. Do not use scale-to-zero hosting; background runs rely on Redis/Postgres-backed workers staying available. If the built-in LangGraph API routes are reachable from the public internet, put the service behind a private network, API gateway, or custom LangGraph auth before using `LANGGRAPH_AUTH_TYPE=noop`.

Set `LANGGRAPH_URL` to the public backend URL so webhooks and the dashboard can create runs against this same server. Set `DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL` to the URL browsers use for dashboard API requests and OAuth callbacks: either the backend URL for direct cross-origin calls, or the dashboard/Vercel URL when a same-origin rewrite proxies `/dashboard/api/*`. Update your webhook URLs (Linear, Slack, GitHub App) and the GitHub App / Slack OAuth callback URLs to your production URLs. The dashboard GitHub App callback must be `<DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL>/dashboard/api/auth/callback`.

The `langgraph.json` at the project root defines the graphs and HTTP app baked into the image:

```json
{
  "graphs": {
    "agent": "agent.graphs.agent:traced_agent",
    "reviewer": "agent.graphs.reviewer:traced_reviewer_agent",
    "analyzer": "agent.graphs.analyzer:traced_analyzer",
    "chat": "agent.graphs.chat:traced_chat_agent",
    "scheduler": "agent.graphs.scheduler:get_scheduler"
  },
  "http": {
    "app": "agent.webapp:app"
  }
}
```

**Backend — LangGraph Cloud / Platform:** alternatively, push your code to a GitHub repository, connect the repo to LangGraph Cloud, set the same environment variables in the deployment config, and use the hosted deployment URL for `LANGGRAPH_URL` and webhook callbacks.

**Dashboard** — the `ui/` app builds to a Nitro server that renders routes on request. Set `DASHBOARD_API_URL` in its environment to your hosted backend URL; it is read per request, so one image serves any backend. Browser requests to `/dashboard/api/*` and webhook deliveries to `/webhooks/*` are proxied to it, and server renders call it directly with the request's `osw_session` cookie forwarded.

Requests are therefore **same-origin**: set both `DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL` and the GitHub App dashboard callback URL to the Vercel/dashboard origin (for example, `https://your-dashboard.vercel.app/dashboard/api/auth/callback`). The OAuth callback response then sets the `osw_session` cookie on the dashboard host, and later `/dashboard/api/*` requests include it.

Alternatively, you can have the browser call the backend cross-origin: set `VITE_DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL` to the hosted backend origin, set `DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL` to that same backend origin, and include the dashboard origin in `DASHBOARD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. Keep `DASHBOARD_API_URL` pointed at the same backend so server renders and the webhook proxy reach it too. In this mode `osw_session` belongs to the backend's origin, so the dashboard's own requests never carry it and the session is resolved on the client instead — pages render unauthenticated and fill in after hydration.

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook not receiving events

- Verify ngrok is running and the URL matches what's configured in GitHub/Linear/Slack
- Check the ngrok web inspector at `http://localhost:4040` for incoming requests
- Ensure you enabled the correct event types (Comments → Create for Linear, `app_mention` for Slack, Issues + Issue comment for GitHub)
- **Webhook secrets are required** — if `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, or `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` is not set, all requests to that endpoint will be rejected with 401

### GitHub authentication errors

- Verify `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID` are set correctly
- Ensure the GitHub App is installed on the target repositories
- Check that the private key includes the full `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` lines

### Dashboard login fails or won't stay logged in

- `500 GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID not configured` (or client secret): set `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` (step 3c) and `DASHBOARD_JWT_SECRET`.
- OAuth `redirect_uri` mismatch: the GitHub App must list `<DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL>/dashboard/api/auth/callback` as a callback URL (step 3b). Locally that's `http://localhost:2024/dashboard/api/auth/callback`.
- Login redirects but the session doesn't stick: this is almost always a cookie problem. Locally, keep `DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL` on `http://` (so cookies are `SameSite=Lax`); in prod use `https://` for both API and frontend and add the frontend origin to `DASHBOARD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
- Login rejected with an org error: `ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS` gates dashboard login (and requires the App's Organization → Members: Read-only permission). See step 5.
- Admin pages 403: add your GitHub login or email to `CONFIGURED_ADMINS`.

### Dashboard UI can't reach the backend

- Confirm the backend is running via `make dev` on `:2024` (not `make run` on `:8000`).
- Confirm the dev server is proxying: `curl -i http://localhost:3000/dashboard/api/me` should return the backend's `401`, not an HTML page. If the backend is on another port, export `DASHBOARD_API_URL` before `make web` or `pnpm run dev`.

### Sandbox creation failures

- Verify `LANGSMITH_API_KEY_PROD` is set and valid
- Check LangSmith sandbox quotas in your workspace settings
- If sandbox creation fails with `No base snapshot configured`, build a snapshot (see step 4c) and either export its UUID as `DEFAULT_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT_ID` or set it as the base snapshot on the admin **Sandbox** page
- If you see `Failed to create sandbox from snapshot '<id>'`, confirm the snapshot exists in your workspace and has status `ready`
- If you get a 403 Forbidden error on the sandbox endpoints, your LangSmith workspace may not have sandbox access enabled — contact LangSmith support

### Agent not responding to comments

- For GitHub: ensure the comment or issue contains `@openswe` (case-insensitive), and the commenter has a user mapping (Admin → User mappings; see "Configure triggering surfaces"). Add any missing user with **Add / update** in that section.
- For Linear: ensure the comment contains `@openswe` (case-insensitive)
- For Slack: ensure the bot is invited to the channel and the message is an `@mention`
- Check server logs for webhook processing errors

### Token encryption errors

- Ensure `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- The key must be a valid 32-byte Fernet-compatible base64 string
- For key rotation, `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` may be a comma- or newline-separated
  list of keys (most-recent-first). See "Rotating TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY" above.
